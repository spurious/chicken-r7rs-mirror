NOTES


* Redefinition of "import" may be tricky, as it is implicit and not in any module.
  - possible reimplement using core functionality.

* Use of "define-values" is elegant but loses lambda-info for the defined procedures.

* "export" does not support "(rename ...)" specifier yet.
  - this needs extensions to the core module system.
