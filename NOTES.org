NOTES


* Redefinition of "import" may be tricky, as it is implicit and not in any module.
  - possible reimplement using core functionality.

* Use of "define-values" is elegant but loses lambda-info for the defined procedures.

* "export" does not support "(rename ...)" specifier yet.
  - this needs extensions to the core module system.

* "(import SYMBOL)" is currently allowed. Should it not?

* Redefinition of "import" causes "re-importing" warnings.
  - The warnings could be removed in core, it's usefulness is not completely clear.

* Just renaming procedures (like from srfi-4) doesn't change their lambda-info names.
  - This is sort of confusing, do we care (or should we "(define new old)")?
  - Also, this makes the locations from errors (from ##sys#check-whatever) wrong/misleading.
